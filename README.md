# Snacktacular-Starter-Project-v4
Starter Project for Snacktacular if you don't want to complete video 8.3. From Prof. Gallaugher's "Learn to Program Using Swift for iOS Development" v.4.

Note: I very much recommend that students go through the video + build this starter user interface themselves. The follow-along tutorial video shows both Challenges if you want to see if you can build on your own, as well as a solution you can follow in case you get stuck. Students in the Zero-to-Full-Stack course very much benefit from practicing concepts, BUT if you're 100% comfortable with these concepts, then you can download this starter project.

If you use this project, remember:
- It assumes you've already set up a Google Project as shown in video: 8.2 http://bit.ly/prof-g-swift
- You'll need to re-run pod install on the project that you download. Be sure you do this from the Terminal after changing directories to your project folder. Also make sure that your project is named Snacktacular, just as the name is listed in the podfile, or the install won't work.
- You'll need to download YOUR project's GoogleServices-Info.plist file and add it to the existing project.
- You'll need to copy the REVERSED_CLIENT_ID from your GoogleServices-Info.plist, just as shown in 8.2, and add it to the URLTypes > URL Schemes area of Targets > Info, as you did in the earlier video, replacing any version you might have added in Ch. 8.2.
- Make sure you update the Bundle Identifier of your project so it's the same as the BundleID that you added in your Google Project in Video 8.2.
- Make sure your own team, and not mine, is selected as the "Team" under your app's "Signing & Capabilites" screen.
